# The Basics of NumPy Arrays


Data manipulation in Python is nearly synonymous with NumPy array manipulation: even newer tools like Pandas ([Chapter 3](03.00-Introduction-to-Pandas.ipynb)) are built around the NumPy array.
This section will present several examples of using NumPy array manipulation to access data and subarrays, and to split, reshape, and join the arrays.
While the types of operations shown here may seem a bit dry and pedantic, they comprise the building blocks of many other examples used throughout the book.
Get to know them well!

We'll cover a few categories of basic array manipulations here:

- *Attributes of arrays*: Determining the size, shape, memory consumption, and data types of arrays
- *Indexing of arrays*: Getting and setting the value of individual array elements
- *Slicing of arrays*: Getting and setting smaller subarrays within a larger array
- *Reshaping of arrays*: Changing the shape of a given array
- *Joining and splitting of arrays*: Combining multiple arrays into one, and splitting one array into many


## NumPy Array Attributes


First let's discuss some useful array attributes.
We'll start by defining random arrays of one, two, and three dimensions.
We'll use NumPy's random number generator, which we will *seed* with a set value in order to ensure that the same random arrays are generated each time this code is run:

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
import numpy as np
rng = np.random.default_rng(seed=1701)  # seed for reproducibility

x1 = rng.integers(10, size=6)  # One-dimensional array
x2 = rng.integers(10, size=(3, 4))  # Two-dimensional array
x3 = rng.integers(10, size=(3, 4, 5))  # Three-dimensional array
```

Each array has attributes including ``ndim`` (the number of dimensions), ``shape`` (the size of each dimension), and ``size`` (the total size of the array), and `dtype` (the type of each element);

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
print("x3 ndim: ", x3.ndim)
print("x3 shape:", x3.shape)
print("x3 size: ", x3.size)
print("dtype:   ", x3.dtype)
```

For more discussion of `dtype`, see [Understanding Data Types in Python](02.01-Understanding-Data-Types.ipynb)):


## Array Indexing: Accessing Single Elements


If you are familiar with Python's standard list indexing, indexing in NumPy will feel quite familiar.
In a one-dimensional array, the $i^{th}$ value (counting from zero) can be accessed by specifying the desired index in square brackets, just as with Python lists:

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
x1
```

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
x1[0]
```

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
x1[4]
```

To index from the end of the array, you can use negative indices:

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
x1[-1]
```

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
x1[-2]
```

In a multi-dimensional array, items can be accessed using a comma-separated `(row, column)` tuple:

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
x2
```

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
x2[0, 0]
```

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
x2[2, 0]
```

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
x2[2, -1]
```

Values can also be modified using any of the above index notation:

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
x2[0, 0] = 12
x2
```

Keep in mind that, unlike Python lists, NumPy arrays have a fixed type.
This means, for example, that if you attempt to insert a floating-point value to an integer array, the value will be silently truncated. Don't be caught unaware by this behavior!

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
x1[0] = 3.14159  # this will be truncated!
x1
```

## Array Slicing: Accessing Subarrays

<!-- #region -->
Just as we can use square brackets to access individual array elements, we can also use them to access subarrays with the *slice* notation, marked by the colon (``:``) character.
The NumPy slicing syntax follows that of the standard Python list; to access a slice of an array ``x``, use this:
``` python
x[start:stop:step]
```
If any of these are unspecified, they default to the values ``start=0``, ``stop=``*``size of dimension``*, ``step=1``.
We'll take a look at accessing sub-arrays in one dimension and in multiple dimensions.
<!-- #endregion -->

### One-dimensional subarrays

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
x1
```

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
x1[:3]  # first three elements
```

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
x1[3:]  # elements after index 3
```

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
x1[1:4]  # middle sub-array
```

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
x1[::2]  # every other element
```

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
x1[1::2]  # every other element, starting at index 1
```

A potentially confusing case is when the ``step`` value is negative.
In this case, the defaults for ``start`` and ``stop`` are swapped.
This becomes a convenient way to reverse an array:

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
x1[::-1]  # all elements, reversed
```

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
x1[4::-2]  # reversed every other from index 4
```

### Multi-dimensional subarrays

Multi-dimensional slices work in the same way, with multiple slices separated by commas.
For example:

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
x2
```

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
x2[:2, :3]  # first two rows & three columns
```

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
x2[:3, ::2]  # three rows, every other column
```

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
x2[::-1, ::-1]  # all rows & columns, reversed
```

#### Accessing array rows and columns

One commonly needed routine is accessing of single rows or columns of an array.
This can be done by combining indexing and slicing, using an empty slice marked by a single colon (``:``):

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
x2[:, 0]  # first column of x2
```

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
x2[0, :]  # first row of x2
```

In the case of row access, the empty slice can be omitted for a more compact syntax:

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
x2[0]  # equivalent to x2[0, :]
```

### Subarrays as no-copy views

Unlike Python list slices, NumPy array slices are returned as *views* rather than *copies* of the array data.
Consider our two-dimensional array from before:

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
print(x2)
```

Let's extract a $2 \times 2$ subarray from this:

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
x2_sub = x2[:2, :2]
print(x2_sub)
```

Now if we modify this subarray, we'll see that the original array is changed! Observe:

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
x2_sub[0, 0] = 99
print(x2_sub)
```

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
print(x2)
```

Some users may find this surprising, but it can be advantageous: for example, when working with large datasets, we can access and process pieces of these datasets without the need to copy the underlying data buffer.


### Creating copies of arrays

Despite the nice features of array views, it is sometimes useful to instead explicitly copy the data within an array or a subarray. This can be most easily done with the ``copy()`` method:

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
x2_sub_copy = x2[:2, :2].copy()
print(x2_sub_copy)
```

If we now modify this subarray, the original array is not touched:

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
x2_sub_copy[0, 0] = 42
print(x2_sub_copy)
```

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
print(x2)
```

## Reshaping of Arrays

Another useful type of operation is reshaping of arrays, which can be done with the ``reshape`` method.
For example, if you want to put the numbers 1 through 9 in a $3 \times 3$ grid, you can do the following:

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
grid = np.arange(1, 10).reshape(3, 3)
print(grid)
```

Note that for this to work, the size of the initial array must match the size of the reshaped array, and in most cases the ``reshape`` method will return a no-copy view of the initial array.


A common reshaping operation is converting a one-dimensional array into a two-dimensional row or column matrix:

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
x.reshape((1, 3))  # row vector via reshape
```

```python
x.reshape((3, 1))  # column vector via reshape
```

A convenient shorthand for this is to use `np.newaxis` within a slicing syntax:

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
x[np.newaxis, :]  # row vector via newaxis
```

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
x[:, np.newaxis]  # column vector via newaxis
```

This is a pattern that we will utilize often through the remainder of the book.


## Array Concatenation and Splitting

All of the preceding routines worked on single arrays. NumPy also provides tools to combine multiple arrays into one, and to conversely split a single array into multiple arrays.


### Concatenation of arrays

Concatenation, or joining of two arrays in NumPy, is primarily accomplished using the routines ``np.concatenate``, ``np.vstack``, and ``np.hstack``.
``np.concatenate`` takes a tuple or list of arrays as its first argument, as we can see here:

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
y = np.array([3, 2, 1])
np.concatenate([x, y])
```

You can also concatenate more than two arrays at once:

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
z = np.array([99, 99, 99])
print(np.concatenate([x, y, z]))
```

It can also be used for two-dimensional arrays:

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
grid = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                 [4, 5, 6]])
```

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
# concatenate along the first axis
np.concatenate([grid, grid])
```

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
# concatenate along the second axis (zero-indexed)
np.concatenate([grid, grid], axis=1)
```

For working with arrays of mixed dimensions, it can be clearer to use the ``np.vstack`` (vertical stack) and ``np.hstack`` (horizontal stack) functions:

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
# vertically stack the arrays
np.vstack([x, grid])
```

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
# horizontally stack the arrays
y = np.array([[99],
              [99]])
np.hstack([grid, y])
```

Similary, for higher-dimensional arrays, ``np.dstack`` will stack arrays along the third axis.


### Splitting of arrays

The opposite of concatenation is splitting, which is implemented by the functions ``np.split``, ``np.hsplit``, and ``np.vsplit``.  For each of these, we can pass a list of indices giving the split points:

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
x = [1, 2, 3, 99, 99, 3, 2, 1]
x1, x2, x3 = np.split(x, [3, 5])
print(x1, x2, x3)
```

Notice that *N* split-points, leads to *N + 1* subarrays.
The related functions ``np.hsplit`` and ``np.vsplit`` are similar:

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
grid = np.arange(16).reshape((4, 4))
grid
```

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
upper, lower = np.vsplit(grid, [2])
print(upper)
print(lower)
```

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
left, right = np.hsplit(grid, [2])
print(left)
print(right)
```

Similarly, for higher-dimensional arrays, ``np.dsplit`` will split arrays along the third axis.
